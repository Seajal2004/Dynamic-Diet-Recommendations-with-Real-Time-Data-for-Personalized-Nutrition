# üçΩÔ∏è Dynamic Diet Recommendations with Real-Time Data for Personalized Nutrition

## üìå Overview

This project presents a **Dynamic Diet Recommendation System** that leverages **real-time data** and **machine learning** to generate personalized diet plans. Unlike traditional static meal plans, this system adapts to the user's changing health conditions, nutritional needs, and activity levels.

Built with a **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** using **Keras**, the system classifies food items into goals such as **Weight Gain**, **Muscle Gain**, and **General Food**, providing intelligent and flexible dietary suggestions.

## üß† Features

- Personalized diet recommendations using user-specific health data
- Real-time adaptability using continuously updated inputs
- Multi-class classification of food based on nutritional content
- Performance visualization (accuracy, loss, confusion matrix)
- Comparative model performance analysis (CNN, RNN, LSTM, SVM)

---

## üß™ Dataset

The dataset includes **4,684 food items** categorized into:
- Weight Gain
- Muscle Gain
- General Food

Each food item contains:
- **Macronutrients**: Energy (kcal), Protein (g), Fat (g), Carbs (g), Fiber (g), Sugar (g)
- **Micronutrients**: Vitamin A, Calcium, Iron, etc. (% of USRDA)

It also includes:
- Food group classification (e.g., Legumes, Baked Products, Finfish)
- Unique food IDs and names for identification

## üí° Key Insights

- CNN outperforms traditional models in accuracy and generalization.
- The model performs best for **Muscle Gain** classification.
- Misclassifications between ‚ÄúGeneral Food‚Äù and ‚ÄúWeight Gain‚Äù occur due to overlapping nutritional content.

## üî≠ Future Scope

- Integration with **IoMT** (Internet of Medical Things) and wearable devices
- Use of **advanced biomarkers** (HRV, lipid profiles) for precise monitoring
- Expansion to handle **chronic disease-specific diets**
- Deployment as a **mobile or web-based app**
- Use of **transfer learning, CNN/RNN hybrids**, and **real-time feedback loops**
